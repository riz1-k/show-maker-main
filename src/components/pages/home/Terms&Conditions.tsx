          We understand that prices may need to be adjusted due to unforeseen
          circumstances, and we will work with the Client to reasonably consider
          any changes needed.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To ensure efficient billing, any invoice queries should be notified to
          SHOWMAKER in writing by the Client within 10 working days of invoice
          receipt. Failure to comply may result in the full invoice becoming
          payable on the due date.

          Client, which were not included in the agreed proposal, will be
          separately invoiced by SHOWMAKER after the event.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The remaining 50% of the total fee, as agreed in the written proposal,
          must be paid no later than 14 working days before the event date.

          This clause applies to the cancellation of the entire event, partial
          use of facilities for the event, or reduction in the duration of the
          event resulting in a reduced contracted value.

          to the total charge, including required accommodation, function room

        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The client will also be responsible for settling any third-party

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">

          <li>
            If the revised event date is agreed upon and takes place within 100
            working days of the original event date, payments received by
            SHOWMAKER from the client shall form a credit towards the future
            event.
          </li>
          <li>
            The client shall be liable for any and all costs or expenses

        <p className="mb-4">
          While SHOWMAKER takes every reasonable precaution to ensure the safety
          of all guests and attendees at events, it cannot be held responsible
          for any injuries, damages, losses, or delays that may occur during the
          event, unless it results from SHOWMAKER's negligence or breach of
          contract. It is possible that some activities at the event may carry
          inherent risks, and in such cases, SHOWMAKER may require individuals
          to sign a liability waiver on the day of the event. However, this
          waiver does not absolve SHOWMAKER of any responsibility for damage to
          personal property of the Clients' employees or staff, property damage
          caused to the Clients' property, or personal injury arising from
          SHOWMAKER's negligence. SHOWMAKER agrees to indemnify and hold the
          Client harmless against all such claims in instances where a liability
          waiver has been signed.

          Force Majeure - SHOWMAKER will not be held responsible for any delays

          God, natural disasters, strikes, or other labor disputes, power
          outages, pandemics, or governmental restrictions or regulations. In
          such cases, SHOWMAKER shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of
